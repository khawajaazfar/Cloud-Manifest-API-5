# Note-
```py
'''
Always try to make more then 6 pull requests.
Let's assume you have made only 6 pull request to different projects.
but one project is excluded from hackoctoberfest event.
Then your pull request will not be counted and you will just have 5 valid pull requests.
If this happens then you will not get any swags or t-shirt.

<h1 align="center"> ☁️ Cloud-Manifest-API-5</h1>

**Cloud-Manifest-API-5** is a futuristic cloud service orchestration and deployment management system.  
It handles cloud manifests, API-based deployments, and intelligent optimization of cloud configurations — all through a modular and scalable API framework.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project enables **multi-cloud manifest management**, **automated deployments**, and **AI-assisted configuration optimization**.  
You can manage, validate, and deploy YAML/JSON manifests across **AWS, GCP, and Azure** — directly via API or CLI.

---

## 🧩 1. Core Files & Modules

| File / Folder | Purpose |
|----------------|----------|
| `main.py` / `app.js` / `main.cpp` | Entry point — starts API server or controller logic |
| `manifest_handler.py` | Reads and processes YAML/JSON manifests for cloud resources |
| `cloud_manager.py` | Connects to cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) to deploy or update configurations |
| `api_routes.py` | REST API endpoints for CRUD operations on manifests |
| `database.py` | Manages manifest storage (e.g., MongoDB or SQLite) |
| `config.yaml` | Stores cloud credentials and default deployment settings |
| `utils/logger.py` | Unified logging system with timestamps and levels (INFO, ERROR, etc.) |
| `auth.py` | JWT or API key authentication for API security |

---

## ☁️ 2. Cloud Features

### ✅ Cloud Deployment Engine
- Parses and applies deployment manifests automatically.  
- Supports **multiple cloud providers** (AWS, GCP, Azure).  
- Can auto-generate **Terraform** or **Kubernetes** configurations.

### ⚙️ Manifest Validator
- Validates schema and structure of manifests before deployment.  
- Automatically fixes minor formatting errors.

**CLI Usage:**
```bash
python manifest_validator.py manifest.yaml
```
## 🌐 3. API Layer — Cloud Manifest API

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `/api/manifests` | **GET** | List all manifests |
| `/api/manifests` | **POST** | Upload a new manifest |
| `/api/manifests/{id}` | **PUT** | Update a manifest |
| `/api/deploy/{id}` | **POST** | Deploy a specific manifest |
| `/api/logs` | **GET** | View recent deployment logs |
| `/api/suggestions` | **GET** | Get AI-based configuration recommendations |

---

## 🧠 4. Smart Add-ons (Futuristic Features)

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **AI Config Generator** | Converts natural language prompts (e.g., “Deploy Node.js app on AWS Lambda”) into ready-to-deploy manifest files. |
| **Version Control** | Tracks all manifest revisions with rollback capabilities for safer updates. |
| **Dashboard (React / Flask)** | Displays deployments, resource status, logs, and cost estimates visually. |
| **Notification System** | Sends deployment success/failure alerts via Email or Discord webhook. |
| **CLI Tool (`cloudctl`)** | Command-line tool for managing manifests and deployments directly from the terminal. |

---

## 🧰 5. Bonus Features (Perfect for Hacktoberfest & Portfolio Projects)

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🐳 **Dockerized Setup** | Includes `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` for containerized deployment. |
| 📜 **OpenAPI / Swagger Docs** | Automatically generated API documentation for all endpoints. |
| 🔒 **JWT + OAuth2 Authentication** | Secure user and API access using industry-standard authentication methods. |
| 🧪 **Unit Tests (pytest / jest)** | Comprehensive automated testing suite to ensure reliability. |
| ⚙️ **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)** | Continuous integration and deployment pipeline for automated testing and delivery. |
| 📊 **Prometheus Integration** | Real-time metrics, performance monitoring, and health checks for your cloud API. |
